# **IntraDay Sales â€“ Real-Time Data Engineering Pipeline**

This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline**. It captures streaming data via **Apache Kafka**, processes it using **Apache Spark**, and stores the transformed data in **Cassandra** for efficient querying. The workflow is orchestrated with **Apache Airflow**, while **Superset** provides real-time visualization and analytics.

All components are fully containerized with **Docker**, ensuring **seamless deployment, scalability, and portability** across environments.

The pipeline flow can be summarized as:

1. **Data Source:** Real-time streaming data ingested via **Apache Kafka**.  
2. **Apache Kafka & Zookeeper:** Handle **real-time streaming**, ensuring smooth coordination between producers and consumers.  
3. **Control Center & Schema Registry:** Monitor Kafka streams and manage message schemas effectively.  
4. **Apache Spark:** Performs **real-time processing**, transformations, and aggregations on the streaming data.  
5. **Cassandra:** Stores processed data for **fast and scalable querying**.  
6. **Superset:** Visualizes the processed data through **interactive dashboards**, enabling real-time insights.
